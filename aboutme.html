     <h3> Coding For Life</h3>
     <div class = "para">
     <pre> 
        I just love robots, science and coding. I started with scratch, by giving instructions 
        to a robot,learning html in school, and then I joined WhiteHat Jr. This is
        the best ever institution which helped me understand the coding language much 
        easily. I started building games and covert them into appsand now I'm learning 
        how to build web pages.
